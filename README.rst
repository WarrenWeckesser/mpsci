mpsci
=====

``mpsci`` is a Python module that defines an assortment of numerical
formulas and algorithms.  The library `mpmath` is used for floating point
calculations.

Much of the code in ``mpsci`` was developed as a way to find the
"true" values to be used in SciPy unit tests.

There has not been an official release of ``mpsci``; the GitHub repository
is the only source of the code.  The API is not stable and may change
frequently.
