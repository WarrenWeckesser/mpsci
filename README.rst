mpsci
=====

``mpsci`` is a Python module that defines an assortment of numerical
formulas and algorithms.  The library `mpmath` is used for floating point
calculations.

Most of the code in ``mpsci`` was developed as a way to find the
"true" values to be used in SciPy unit tests.

The package should be considered prototype-quality software.  There
will probably be backwards-incompatible API changes as the code is expanded.
